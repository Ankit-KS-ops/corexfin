# Corexfin Banking Solutions

## Project Overview
Corexfin Banking Solutions is a scalable, secure microservices-based platform designed to support multiple banking institutions under a unified system. The platform enables each bank (e.g., Hex Bank, UBI, SBI) to maintain autonomy with dedicated owners, branches, and users, while benefiting from centralized operational efficiency.

Corexfin handles key banking operations, including account management, transaction processing, and internet banking approvals, all within a secure, compliant, and highly available architecture.

## Key Features
- Multi-bank support with role-based access control  
- Secure authentication using JWT and OAuth2  
- Microservices architecture enabling independent scalability and fault isolation  
- Distributed transaction management with SAGA pattern  
- Asynchronous event-driven communication via Kafka/RabbitMQ  
- Centralized audit logging for compliance  
- Modular services for registration, account, transaction, notification, and more  
- React-based multi-tenant frontend portals  

## Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud  
- **Authentication:** Spring Security, JWT, OAuth2  
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (per microservice), Redis cache  
- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** ELK stack, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger  
- **Security:** TLS, optional mTLS, data encryption  

## Architecture & Microservices
1. **API Gateway** — request routing, authentication, rate limiting  
2. **Auth Service** — login, JWT token management  
3. **Registration Service** — user and bank owner registration, email verification  
4. **Bank Management** — bank and branch administration  
5. **User Service** — user profiles and roles  
6. **Account Service** — account creation, status, balance inquiries  
7. **Transaction Service** — deposits, withdrawals, transfers with SAGA  
8. **Internet Banking Service** — online banking access requests and approvals  
9. **Notification Service** — email, SMS, push notifications  
10. **Audit & Logging Service** — activity tracking and compliance logs  
11. **Admin Portal** — Corexfin global administration  
12. **Config & Discovery Service** — centralized configuration and service registry  
13. **Event Broker** — asynchronous event messaging  

## Development Roadmap
1. Setup infrastructure: Kubernetes, config server, service discovery, API Gateway  
2. Implement Auth & Registration services with JWT onboarding flows  
3. Build Bank Management and User Service  
4. Develop Account and Transaction Services with SAGA pattern  
5. Create Internet Banking module with request and approval workflows  
6. Setup Notification and Audit services  
7. Develop React-based bank and customer portals  
8. Implement testing, security hardening, and rate limiting  
9. Add observability: logging, monitoring, alerting, tracing  
10. Optimize for scale and resilience
